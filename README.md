# A practical introduction to MLIR for HPC with Python

This repository contains the materials for the practical introduction to MLIR for HPC using Python course. Specifically we focus on driving the Python components via the [xDSL](https://github.com/xdslproject/xdsl) framework and use MLIR and LLVM for compiling. If you are participating in one of our organised tutorials then all the required tools will be preinstalled for you to use as part of the session. 

This top level directory contains:
* [lectures](lectures) which holds the PDF lecture material for the course, providing an overview to MLIR, LLVM, and xDSL
* [practicals](practicals) where we get hands on with the concepts to develop a Python compiler and run the resulting executables on a Cray supercomputer.

## Working on your own?

If you are studying this course on your own, i.e. not part of an organised tutorial session, then you can visit our [website](www.xdsl.dev) for more information and ask questions in the [xDSL Zulip chat](https://xdsl.zulipchat.com/)

# xDSL introduction tutorial practicals

These are the practical exercises for the xDSL introduction tutorial, where we have the following directories

* [one](one) is where participants will obtain an overview of building the IR, compiling, and executing for a simple _Hello World_ Python example.
* [two](two) is where we get more in-depth into the details of the dialects and transformations as we add support for the Python _For_ construct, supporting loops in our simple Python compiler.
* [three](three) is where we develop a new dialect and transformation pass to apply threaded parallelism to a loop via the OpenMP dialect, thus parallelising it.
* [src](src) contains the source code (dialect, transformations, and _tinypy_opt_ tool) that will be used throughout these exercises. If you are participating in one of our organised tutorials then this will all be preinstalled for you to use.
